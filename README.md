## HOW TO PLAY:
### :cityscape: STREET PHASE
- CLICK ON A COIN to get it. When you get the coin say loudly "COIN GET" or "PUT THAT IN YOUR WALLET AND SIT ON IT"
- Click a FINANCIAL FIGHTER right in the belly to start a TRADING BATTLE. Click them RIGHT IN THE BELLY. Real close. None of this "Oh the hitbox should be larger" nonsense. **Jez tip: If there's no one else playing, open a new window/tab and fight against the idle fighter. Or invite a friend!**
- Watch people move around and be part of the HUSTLE AND BUSTLE of the financial district.
- Participate in NON-VERBAL FINANCIAL INTERACTION with your fellow businesspeople.

### :boom: BATTLE PHASE
- During the BATTLE PHASE, fighters are given a chance to invest in other fighter's stocks and gain a COMPETITIVE EDGE.
- Fighters need to buy and sell stocks to meet their AGGRESSIVE PROFIT QUOTAS. You must end with more assets than you started with!
- Due to INSIDER TRADING LAWS the other fighter DOES NOT PARTAKE in during the trading battle. Victory is YOURS FOR THE TAKING.
- Are you COOPERATING or COMPETING with your fellow fighter? Who can tell?
- Winning the financial battle will give you a 49% SHARE of your opponent's assets. Your opponent doesn't lose anything though? Sounds like a GOOD DEAL TO ME.
- Added winning bonus: Gain LUCRATIVE STOCKS that generate dividend money while you sit there!
- Losing will HALF FINANCIAL QUARTER your total money! By which we mean losing will make you lose half your money.

## :question: *The mystery name*
- Every player gets their own name but they don't know what it is! Only by climbing the ranks of the HIGHSCORE TABLE and by PROCESS OF ELIMINATION can you discover your TRUE IDENTITY

## :two_men_holding_hands: TEAM UP WITH A FRIEND
- Insider trading NEVER LOOKED SO GREAT! Just DON'T TELL THE COPS.

## :cyclone: EMBRACE THE VOID
- Go too far away from the starting zone and you PROBABLY WON'T BE ABLE TO FIND YOUR WAY BACK. Become one with the void!

## :family: YES THIS IS ACTUALLY MULTIPLAYER
- All the other people are people that are currently playing this game or people that have WALKED AWAY AND GOT BORED.

## :no_mobile_phones: DESKTOP ONLY FOR THE MOMENT
- DOESN'T WORK TO WELL ON MOBILE. The CSS is KIND OF BROKEN.
